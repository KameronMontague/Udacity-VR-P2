Hello and thank you for reviewing my project. This project I decided to add alot of extra
cool stuff to make it more interesting. However I believe I am still following the rules
of the course, just with alittle help from the unity store. With that said I will need to
give credit to a few people because I did not create alot of the props/meshs/characters. The
extra apartment prefab however is my work that I created myself with the help of a youtube
tutorial a year ago about. Heres a list giving credit to each item I didnt create but just altered...

Udacity(you guys)
-Apartment
-props
-textures

Unitychan(Unity Store)
-All i did with this sprite is make the material shaders unlit. And edited the animations.

Alien Sprite(Unity Store)
-I got this from the app store and I just played with the animations a bit.

Morgue scene(App Store)
-I used this file from the store in my horror apartment that I made. It came with alot of props
and textures so I got creative and made a creepy scene to match all the morgue stuff.

Music and Sounds(Online)
-Jazzy Duck: From playonloop.com
-Cosmo Joker: From dievantile.com
-All sound effects: From freesfx.co.uk

Everything else was created and edited by me. While designing the two apartments in the scene
I decided to only put UnityChan in the Udacity apartment given to me by you. All other objects
that you did not give me are in the horror apartment section of the scene. Also I would like
to point out that the clock in the first room works and runs at a normal clock speed. All three
hands move according to what they are. The time always starts at midnight. I wanted to look up
the code for tracking the users timezone and intirgrating that into the clock hands but that
would of took away from what this project was suppose to teach me.

I you enjoy the ride, thank you.
